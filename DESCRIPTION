Package: LedPred
Title: Learning from DNA to Predict enhancers
Description: This package aims at creating a predictive model of regulatory sequences used to score unknown sequences based on the content of DNA motifs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) peaks and signals and other numerical scores of the sequences using supervised classification. The package contains a workflow based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm that maps features to sequences, optimize SVM parameters and feature number and creates a model that can be stored and used to score the regulatory potential of unknown sequences.
