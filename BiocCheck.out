* This is BiocCheck, version 1.4.0.
* BiocCheck is a work in progress. Output and severity of issues may
  change.
* Installing package...
Note: the specification for S3 class “AsIs” in package ‘jsonlite’ seems equivalent to one from package ‘BiocGenerics’: not turning on duplicate class definitions for this class.
    * CONSIDER: Clarifying how object ‘AvgRank’ (used in rankFeatures)
      was initialized. Maybe it is part of a data set loaded with
      data(), or perhaps part of an object referenced in with() or
      within().
* This is a software package, checking vignette directories...
* # of chunks: 13, # of eval=FALSE: 4 (30%)
* Checking version number...
* Checking R Version dependency...
* Checking biocViews...
    * CONSIDER: Adding some of these automatically suggested biocViews:
      Sequencing, WorkflowStep, Classification
See http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/biocViews/
* Checking build system compatibility...
* Checking unit tests...
* Checking native routine registration...
* Checking for deprecated package usage...
* Parsing R code in R directory, examples, vignettes...
* Checking for direct slot access...
* Checking for T...
* Checking for F...
* Checking for browser()...
* Checking for <<-...
* Checking for library/require of LedPred...
* Checking DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE consistency...
* Checking function lengths..........
* The longest function is 195 lines long
* The longest 5 functions are:
* mcTune() (R/ledpred.R, line 353): 195 lines
* mapFeaturesToCRMs() (R/ledpred.R, line 102): 139 lines
* .svmRFE() (R/ledpred.R, line 676): 84 lines
* _anonymous_.415() (R/ledpred.R, line 415): 75 lines
* rankFeatures() (R/ledpred.R, line 572): 58 lines
* Checking man pages...
* Checking exported objects have runnable examples...
    * CONSIDER: Adding runnable examples to the following man pages
      which document exported objects:
      mapFeaturesToCRMs.Rd
* Checking package NEWS...
    * CONSIDER: Adding a NEWS file, so your package news will be
      included in Bioconductor release announcements.
* Checking formatting of DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man pages, R source,
  and vignette source...
    * CONSIDER: Shortening lines; 298 lines (14%) are > 80 characters
      long.
    * CONSIDER: Replacing tabs with 4 spaces; 5 lines (0%) contain
      tabs.
    * CONSIDER: Indenting lines with a multiple of 4 spaces; 638 lines
      (30%) are not.
  See http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/coding-style/
* Checking for canned comments in man pages...
* Checking if package already exists in CRAN...
