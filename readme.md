#Â Learning from DNA to Predict enhancers (LedPred)

This R package aims at creating a predictive model of regulatory sequences used to score unknown sequences based on the content of DNA motifs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) peaks and signals and other numerical scores of the sequences using supervised classification. The package contains a workflow based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm that maps features to sequences, optimize SVM parameters and feature number and creates a model that can be stored and used to score the regulatory potential of unknown sequences. This R package is available in the [Bioconductor release](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/LedPred.html) and [Bioconductor devel](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/LedPred.html) repositories.
